# Zomato_Sales_Analysis_Project
Zomato sales analysis using Python involves examining a dataset containing information about restaurants, their offerings, ratings, and customer interactions to extract insights and patterns. This analysis typically focuses on understanding various aspects of Zomato's operations and customer behavior, such as:

**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
This initial step involves loading the Zomato dataset (often obtained from platforms like Kaggle) into a Python environment, usually using the Pandas library. Subsequently, data cleaning and preprocessing are performed to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and transform data types for accurate analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

EDA is a crucial phase where the dataset is explored to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships. This can involve:
.Analyzing restaurant types, cuisines, and their popularity.
.Investigating the distribution of ratings and votes to understand customer satisfaction.
.Examining the impact of factors like online ordering and table booking on restaurant performance.
.Understanding pricing trends and customer spending behavior.
